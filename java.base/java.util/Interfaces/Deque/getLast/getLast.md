This code creates a Deque object using the LinkedList implementation, adds some elements to it, and then gets the last element using the getLast() method. The last element is then printed to the console using System.out.println(). The getLast() method returns the last element of the deque, or throws a NoSuchElementException if the deque is empty. Note that the getLast() method does not remove the element from the deque. If you want to remove the last element of the deque, you can use the removeLast() method.
