In this example, we create a Deque object of type String using the LinkedList class. We then add three elements to the back of the deque using the addLast(E e) method.

Next, we check if the deque contains the element "B" using the contains(Object o) method. This method returns true if the deque contains the specified element, and false otherwise. We then print the result of the contains() method to the console.

Note that the contains(Object o) method searches the deque for the specified element using the equals() method of the element type. Therefore, if the element type does not override the equals() method, the contains() method may not work as expected.
