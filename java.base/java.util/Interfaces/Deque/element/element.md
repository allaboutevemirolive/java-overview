This code creates a Deque object using the LinkedList implementation, adds some elements to it, and then gets the first element using the element() method. The first element is then printed to the console using System.out.println(). 
> The element() method returns the first element of the deque, or 

> throws a NoSuchElementException if the deque is empty. 

Note that the element() method does not remove the element from the deque. If you want to remove the first element of the deque, you can use the remove() method.
