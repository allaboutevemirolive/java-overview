What is the purpose of this constructor

HashMap(Map<? extends K,? extends V> m)
```

The `HashMap(Map<? extends K,? extends V> m)` constructor is used to create a new `HashMap` object with the same mappings as the specified `Map` object `m`. This constructor takes a single argument, which is a `Map` object whose key-value pairs will be copied into the new `HashMap`.

When this constructor is called, a new `HashMap` object is created and initialized with the mappings from the specified `Map` object `m`. The type parameters of the new `HashMap` object must be compatible with the type parameters of the `Map` object `m`.
```
This constructor is useful when you need to create a new `HashMap` object that has the same mappings as an existing `Map` object. 
```
Instead of iterating over the entries of the existing `Map` object and adding them one by one to the new `HashMap`, you can simply pass the existing `Map` object as an argument to this constructor, and the new `HashMap` will be initialized with the same mappings.

Here's an example of how you could use this constructor to create a new `HashMap` object that is a copy of an existing `Map` object:

```java
Map<String, Integer> originalMap = new HashMap<>();
originalMap.put("apple", 3);
originalMap.put("banana", 2);
originalMap.put("orange", 5);

Map<String, Integer> newMap = new HashMap<>(originalMap);

System.out.println("originalMap: " + originalMap);
System.out.println("newMap: " + newMap);
```

In this example, we create an original `HashMap` object called `originalMap` and populate it with some key-value pairs. Then, we create a new `HashMa`p object called `newMap` using the constructor that takes a `Map` object as its argument, and pass `originalMap` as the argument. The new `HashMap` object `newMap` will be initialized with the same key-value pairs as `originalMap`. Finally, we print the contents of both maps to verify that they are the same.

Generate me list of types used for the key and value parameters for this constructor :

HashMap(Map<? extends K,? extends V> m)
```
Sure, here's a list of some commonly used types for the key and value parameters in a `HashMap`:

**Key types:**
- Integer
- String
- Double
- Float
- Character
- Boolean
- Enum
- Class
- Custom classes with properly implemented `equals()` and `hashCode()` methods

**Value types:**
- Integer
- String
- Double
- Float
- Character
- Boolean
- Object
- Collection
- List
- Set
- Map
- Custom classes

Note that these are just some examples, and there are many other types that can be used for the key and value parameters depending on the specific use case.
