Why use InitialCapacity and loadFactor in the code above?

The `initialCapacity` and `loadFactor` parameters in the `HashMap` constructor are used to configure the initial size and behavior of the HashMap.

The `initialCapacity` parameter specifies the initial size of the HashMap, which is the number of buckets that the HashMap will have when it is first created. This can be used to optimize the HashMap's performance for a specific use case. For example, if you know that your HashMap will always contain a certain number of elements, you can set the initial capacity to that number to avoid having to resize the HashMap later on, which can be an expensive operation.

The `loadFactor` parameter specifies the load factor of the HashMap, which is a value between 0 and 1 that determines when the HashMap should resize itself to maintain a good balance between space and time complexity. Specifically, the load factor is the percentage of the HashMap's capacity that can be filled with entries before the HashMap is resized. 

For example, a load factor of 0.75 means that the HashMap will resize itself when it is 75% full. By tuning the load factor, you can balance the trade-off between space and time complexity. A higher load factor means that the HashMap will take up less memory, but it may become slower as it fills up. A lower load factor means that the HashMap will be faster as it fills up, but it will take up more memory.
