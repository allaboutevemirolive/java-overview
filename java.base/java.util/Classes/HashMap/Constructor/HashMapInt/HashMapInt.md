In this example, we create a HashMap object called map with an initial capacity of 10 using the constructor that takes only the initialCapacity parameter. We then add some key-value pairs to the map and print its size and contents.

By specifying the initial capacity of the HashMap, we can optimize its performance for a specific use case. In this case, we know that the HashMap will contain at least three elements, so we set the initial capacity to 10 to avoid having to resize the HashMap later on, which can be an expensive operation. However, note that setting the initial capacity too high can also waste memory, so it's important to choose a reasonable value based on your expected usage patterns.

What do you mean by " resize the HashMap later on, which can be an expensive operation" ?

```
In a HashMap, the key-value pairs are stored in an array of "buckets". Each bucket is a linked list that stores all the key-value pairs that hash to the same index in the array.

When you add a new key-value pair to a HashMap, the HashMap calculates the hash code of the key and uses it to find the index of the corresponding bucket in the array. If the bucket is already occupied by another key-value pair, the new key-value pair is simply added to the end of the linked list. If the bucket is empty, a new node is created at the beginning of the linked list to store the new key-value pair.

If the number of key-value pairs in the HashMap grows beyond a certain threshold, the HashMap needs to resize the array to maintain a good balance between space and time complexity. Specifically, the HashMap creates a new, larger array and rehashes all the existing key-value pairs to new indices in the array. This is necessary because as the number of key-value pairs grows, the likelihood of hash collisions (i.e., two keys hashing to the same index) increases, which can cause the performance of the HashMap to degrade.

Resizing the HashMap can be an expensive operation, especially if the HashMap contains a large number of key-value pairs. During the resize operation, all the existing key-value pairs need to be rehashed and reinserted into the new array, which can take a significant amount of time and memory. By setting the initial capacity of the HashMap to a reasonable value, we can minimize the number of times that the HashMap needs to be resized, which can help improve the performance of our code.

Explain to me in simple terms

```

A HashMap is a way to store data in Java. It works by using a special calculation (called a hash code) to find a place in memory to store each piece of data. When we want to add new data to the HashMap, it finds a place in memory to store it using this hash code.

If we set the initial capacity of the HashMap too low, it might not have enough space in memory to store all the data we want to add. This can cause the HashMap to have to move data around in memory (which is slow), or even resize itself (which is really slow). By setting the initial capacity to a higher value, we can help the HashMap have enough space in memory to store our data without having to move or resize things around as often. This can make our code run faster.

What is the maximum initialCapacity available?

```
The maximum initialCapacity value you can set when creating a HashMap in Java is Integer.MAX_VALUE. However, it's important to note that setting the initial capacity to such a large value is not always a good idea.

The initialCapacity parameter determines the size of the internal array used by the HashMap. A large initial capacity means that the array will be larger, which can help reduce the number of times the HashMap needs to resize itself as more elements are added to it. However, a very large initial capacity can also waste memory, especially if the HashMap is not going to hold a large number of elements.

In general, it's a good idea to choose an initial capacity that is appropriate for the expected number of elements that the HashMap will hold. If you set the initial capacity too high, you might be wasting memory. If you set it too low, the HashMap might need to resize itself more frequently, which can cause performance issues.

Give me ideal example of initalCapacity based on certain number of element in HashMap

```

Sure, here's an example of how to choose an appropriate initial capacity for a HashMap based on the expected number of elements it will hold.

Suppose you know that your HashMap will need to store 1000 key-value pairs. You want to choose an initial capacity that is large enough to avoid frequent resizing, but not so large that it wastes memory.

> A common rule of thumb is to choose an initial capacity that is about twice the expected number of elements. 

In this case, we would choose an initial capacity of 2000. This should give the HashMap enough space to store all 1000 key-value pairs without having to resize itself, while also avoiding excessive memory usage.

Here's an example of how to create a HashMap with an initial capacity of 2000:

```java
HashMap<String, Integer> map = new HashMap<>(2000);
```
Of course, the ideal initial capacity will depend on the specific requirements of your use case, and there is no one-size-fits-all solution. You might need to experiment with different values to find the best initial capacity for your particular situation.
