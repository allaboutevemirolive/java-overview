In this code, we first create a new `HashMap<String, Integer>` object called `map`. We then add some key-value pairs to the map using the `put()` method.

We then use the `compute()` method to compute the value of an existing key "two" by multiplying its existing value by 10. The `compute()` method takes two arguments: the key to be computed and a `BiFunction<? super K,? super V,? extends V>` object that defines how the value should be computed. In this case, we use a lambda expression that takes the existing key and value as input, and returns the computed value by multiplying the value by 10.

We then use the `compute()` method again to compute the value of a non-existing key "four". Since the key does not exist in the map, the `compute()` method will create a new key-value pair with a value of 4. We use a lambda expression that checks if the value is null (i.e., the key does not exist in the map), and returns either 4 (if the value is null) or the existing value plus 4 (if the value is not null).

Finally, we display the contents of the `map` using the `toString()` method to show the updated key-value pairs.

When you run this code, the output should be:

```java

{four=4, one=1, two=20, three=3}

```
Note that the value of the key "two" has been computed to be 20, and the new key-value pair "four=4" has been added to the map.
