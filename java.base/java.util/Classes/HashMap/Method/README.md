What is the different between :

HashMap<String, Integer> map = new HashMap<>();

and this :

Map<String, Integer> map = new HashMap<>();
```
The difference between these two lines of code is in the type of the variable `map`.

The first line of code creates a `HashMap<String, Integer>` object and assigns it to a variable called `map`. This means that `map` can only refer to objects of type `HashMap<String, Integer>`. This is an example of coding to the implementation, as it explicitly uses the `HashMap` class in the code.

The second line of code creates a `HashMap<String, Integer>` object and assigns it to a variable of type `Map<String, Integer>`. This means that `map` can refer to any object that implements the `Map<String, Integer>` interface, not just `HashMap<String, Integer>`. This is an example of coding to the interface, as it uses the `Map` interface instead of the `HashMap` class in the code.

Using the second approach allows for more flexibility in the code, as it allows you to switch out the implementation of the `Map` interface without changing the code that uses it. For example, you could change the type of `map` to `TreeMap<String, Integer>()` if you wanted to use a `TreeMap` instead of a `HashMap`, and the rest of the code would still work the same way.

```
Meaning you can use the method for Map interface and HashMap class at the same time?
```

Yes, that's correct! By declaring the variable `map` as type `Map<String, Integer>`, you can use any method that is part of the `Map` interface, including the methods that are inherited by the `HashMap` class.

For example, you can call the `put()` method on a `Map<String, Integer>` object to add a new key-value pair, and you can also call the `get()` method to retrieve the value associated with a given key. Both of these methods are defined by the `Map` interface and are implemented by the `HashMap` class.

Similarly, you can call the `keySet()` method on a `Map<String, Integer>` object to get a set of all the keys in the map, and this will return a `Set` object that is also part of the Java Collections Framework.

Declaring the variable `map` as type Map<String, Integer> allows you to write more generic code that can work with any implementation of the `Map` interface, not just `HashMap`. This can make your code more flexible and easier to maintain in the long run.



```
What is the cons when using the second approach ?
```

One disadvantage of using the second approach (declaring the variable as `Map<K, V>` instead of `HashMap<K, V>`) is that you may not be able to use some of the specific methods that are only available in the `HashMap` class, if you need them.

For example, if you need to access the values in the `HashMap` in the order they were inserted, you could use the `LinkedHashMap` class instead of `HashMap`, which maintains the order of the keys. However, the `LinkedHashMap` class is not part of the `Map` interface, so you would not be able to use it if you had declared the variable as `Map<K, V>`.

Another potential disadvantage is that using the more generic type `Map<K, V>` may require more casting to specific types in some cases. For example, if you know that a variable is referring to a `HashMap<String, Integer>` object, and you want to call a method that is only available in the `HashMap` class, you may need to cast the variable to `HashMap<String, Integer>` before you can call the method.

Overall, the decision of whether to declare a variable as the more generic `Map<K, V>` type or the more specific `HashMap<K, V>` type depends on the requirements of your program and the specific methods that you need to use.

What is the different between :

BiFunction<Integer, Integer, Integer> remappingFunction = (v1, v2) -> v1 + v2;

and this :

BinaryOperator<Integer> remappingFunction = (v1, v2) -> v1 + v2;
```

The main difference between `BiFunction<Integer, Integer, Integer>` and `BinaryOperator<Integer>` is that `BinaryOperator<Integer>` is a specialized version of `BiFunction<Integer, Integer, Integer>` that takes two arguments of the same type and returns a result of the same type.

In other words, `BinaryOperator<T>` is a functional interface that extends `BiFunction<T, T, T>` and represents an operation that takes two values of type `T` and returns a result of type `T`. The `apply` method of `BinaryOperator<T>` takes two arguments of type `T` and returns a result of type `T`.

On the other hand, `BiFunction<T, U, R>` is a more general functional interface that takes two arguments of types `T` and `U`, and returns a result of type `R`. The `apply` method of `BiFunction<T, U, R>` takes two arguments of types `T` and `U`, and returns a result of type `R`.

In terms of the two lambda expressions you provided, both of them are equivalent and perform the same operation of adding two `Integer` values together. However, the second lambda expression that uses `BinaryOperator<Integer>` is more concise and specialized to our specific use case, as we are working with two `Integer` values and returning an `Integer` value.

What is the different between :

HashMap<String, Integer> map = new HashMap<>();

and this :

HashMap<String, Integer> hashMap = HashMap.<String, Integer>newHashMap(5);
```

Both 

`HashMap<String, Integer> map = new HashMap<>();` and 

`HashMap<String, Integer> hashMap = HashMap.<String, Integer>newHashMap(5);` 

create new instances of HashMap with different initial capacities and creation methods.
```
HashMap<String, Integer> map = new HashMap<>();

creates a new instance of HashMap with an initial capacity of 16 and the default load factor of 0.75. This is the most commonly used way to create a new HashMap in Java.
```
```
HashMap<String, Integer> hashMap = HashMap.<String, Integer>newHashMap(5);

creates a new instance of HashMap with an initial capacity of 5 and the default load factor of 0.75, using the newHashMap method defined in the question.
```
```
In general, using new HashMap<>() is sufficient for most use cases, 

as the HashMap will automatically resize itself as more entries are added. 
```
```
However, if you have a good estimate of the number of entries you will be adding to the map, 

using newHashMap(int numMappings) method can help to reduce the number of resize operations, and therefore increase performance.
